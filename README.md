# 🌫️ Air Quality Monitoring & Control System

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **smart air quality monitoring device** designed to detect harmful gases and pollutants in the environment. It features a **local display** for real-time readings and a **Wi-Fi connection** for remote monitoring via the **Blynk app**. Additionally, it includes a **relay module** that can automatically trigger external devices such as **fans or air purifiers** based on air quality levels.

## 🔧 Features

* 📊 **Real-Time Air Quality Readings**

  * Detects multiple pollutants using:

    * **MQ-2** (smoke and combustible gases)
    * **MQ-7** (carbon monoxide)
    * **MQ-135** (air quality and harmful gases)

* 🖥️ **On-Device Display**

  * LCD screen displays live sensor data for quick local monitoring.

* 📱 **Wi-Fi Connectivity**

  * Sends data to the **Blynk IoT platform**, allowing users to:

    * View live readings on their phone
    * Receive alerts when air quality drops below a set threshold

* ⚡ **Relay-Controlled Automation**

  * Integrated **relay module** can activate external systems like:

    * Exhaust fans
    * Air purifiers
    * Alarms or indicators
  * Triggered automatically based on sensor thresholds
